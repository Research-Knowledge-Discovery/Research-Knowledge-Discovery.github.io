<!--    <p class="content">Welcome to the Knowledge Discovery Group of the Institute for Information Sciences (IWS) at Technische Hochschule Köln (TH Köln - University of Applied Sciences in Cologne). The founders Prof. Heisenberg (Data Science), Prof. Schaer (Information Retrieval), Prof. Lepsky (Knowledge Organization) and Sven Wöhrle, M.Sc. (Research Coordination) have joined forces for merging the synergies of their individual research areas. This website lists all relevant projects and publications in this respect. Feel free to explore and contact us in case of joint research interests and research proposals.</p>

    <h2 class="title has-text-centered home">What is Knowledge Discovery?</h2>
    <p>Information is the basis for decisions and processes in business, politics and science. The lack of required information and the use of incorrect information can have serious consequences. Methods and procedures of Data and Information Science such as information analysis, information processing, information retrieval and information system design technologies serve the goal of improving the availability of information and satisfying the information needs of individuals and organizations.
    The ultimate goal of both data and information science is to generate knowledge. Abstractly, the process is outlined as follows: Data is assigned meaning through the application of semantics. The information thus obtained serves as a basis for linking to concrete applications through pragmatics and networking. This last step is what we think of as applicable knowledge. This knowledge can then be used to solve various problems.

    Technically spoken, such a process of knowledge discovery or knowledge generation is implemented by Knowledge Discovery methods. -->
    <p>Knowledge discovery describes the process of automatically searching and processing large amounts of data for patterns that can be considered knowledge about the data. The processes and approaches have evolved from and are closely related to the data mining domain, both methodologically and terminologically.
    Knowledge Discovery is lived at our institute as an agile process model, in which different techniques and procedures are used at different points in time. In the KD research group, these include the following disciplines, each of which is covered by a different group member:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information Organization: Enhancing existing data with structures and annotations and making them data by means of structures and annotations, e.g. by means of data enrichment, Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Organization Systems.</li>
        <li>Information Access: Selection of relevant data and information e.g. by web crawling, information retrieval and recommender systems.</li>
    <li>Knowledge Acquisition: analysis of pre-processed data and information with quantitative statistical methods, using text/data mining and machine/deep learning techniques.</li>
    </ul>
