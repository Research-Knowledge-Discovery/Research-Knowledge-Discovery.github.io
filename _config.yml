# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Defining front matter defaults. This provides default values for front matters and prevents 
# having to manually set, for example, a layout on every file. Empty front matters must still
# be given on pages that should be processed by Jekyll and output in the _site directory.

# Front matter defaults can override one another by specifity of the path given and page types.

# Adding collections. Collections provide an easy to set up an architecture for group related
# content, such as members of a group or talks at a conference. New entries to a collection
# can be given by creating a new file in the directory the collection is stored in and providing
# data in the frot matter.
# output needs to be set to true so collection pages are rendered. output is set to false by
# default.
# Collection "news" refers so short news displayed on page "home".
# A permalink is set to manage the output path of collection item output pages.
