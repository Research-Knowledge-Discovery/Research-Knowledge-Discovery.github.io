## Research Knowledge Discovery - Connecting Research and Society

The scientific system is highly complex, and its artifacts and entities - scientific publications, research data, and actors such as researchers, organizations, and companies - are closely intertwined.
In the research focus Research Knowledge Discovery at the Cologne University of Technology, researchers from the fields of Information Science, Data Science, and Computer Science work together interdisciplinary to support the scientific discovery process and make research and its results accessible to society.

We apply and further develop methods of artificial intelligence, machine learning, information science, and knowledge organization to analyze scientific and other topics. Hidden knowledge from domain-specific data sources (e.g., scientific texts, geospatial data, images, surveys, time series, genome sequences) and external knowledge representations are accessed and made available (knowledge access), and therefore, new knowledge is generated (knowledge generation).
In the research focus, we work closely with external partners (e.g., geosciences, economics, and life sciences) who transfer our research results into practice and enable their broad application.
