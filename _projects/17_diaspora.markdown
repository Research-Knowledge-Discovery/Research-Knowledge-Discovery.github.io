DiASPora (Digital Approaches for the Synthesis of Poorly Accessible Biodiversity Information) aimed to enhance the integration, accessibility, and management of bacterial biodiversity information. The project compiled and processed data from various sources, including over 150 scientific journals.

The project utilized the established de.NBI database BacDive to consolidate data in a machine-readable format, making it more accessible. In parallel, new bioinformatic tools were developed for multidimensional analyses of diverse molecular, phenotypic, and ecological data to make bacterial properties more predictable.

## Project Approach
DiASPora brought together scientists from various disciplines, including microbiology, computer science, semantic knowledge management, data science, software development, text mining, and bioinformatics. The project combined complementary approaches:
- Manual curation
- Text mining
- Bioinformatics-based inference
- Machine learning

## Technical Implementation
Using vocabularies and ontologies, the project transformed microbiological data from the BacDive database into a machine-readable format using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). The transformed data was then used to create a knowledge graph that enables innovative search capabilities for discovering new scientific insights and previously hidden data relationships.

## ZB MED's Role
ZB MED contributed to the project by activating microbiological knowledge through text mining of scientific literature, enhancing the accessibility and utility of the collected data.
