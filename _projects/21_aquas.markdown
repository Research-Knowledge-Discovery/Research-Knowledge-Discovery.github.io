## Project Overview
AQUAS addresses the growing challenge of disinformation in scientific literature, particularly in the life sciences. By developing advanced NLP and machine learning techniques, the project aims to automatically assess the quality and reliability of scientific texts, helping researchers and healthcare professionals identify potentially misleading information.

## Key Objectives
- Create the first German-language database on disinformation in life sciences
- Develop machine learning models to classify literature as science, popular science, or disinformation
- Implement an API service for automated quality assessment
- Integrate the service into the ZB MED search portal LIVIVO
- Promote Open Science by making all project outputs openly available

## Technical Approach
1. **Data Collection**
   - Compile reports from authoritative sources on disinformation
   - Include information on research integrity (citations, peer review, retraction status)

2. **Model Development**
   - Train machine learning models to detect patterns of disinformation
   - Implement text classification algorithms
   - Ensure explainability of AI decisions

3. **Integration & Deployment**
   - Develop a RESTful API for the classification service
   - Integrate with the LIVIVO search portal
   - Provide clear documentation and usage guidelines

## ZB MED's Role
As the lead institution, ZB MED is responsible for:
- Project coordination and management
- Database development and maintenance
- Model training and validation
- Service implementation and integration
- Documentation and knowledge transfer

## Ethical Considerations
AQUAS is committed to:
- Not censoring content but providing information about content quality
- Ensuring transparency in AI decision-making
- Respecting user privacy and data protection regulations
- Following Open Science principles throughout the project

## Expected Impact
- Enhanced ability to identify disinformation in life sciences
- Improved quality assessment of scientific literature
- Better support for researchers and healthcare professionals in evaluating information
- Contribution to the broader fight against scientific disinformation
