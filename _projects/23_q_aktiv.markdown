## Project Overview
Q-Aktiv investigated the evolving nature of scientific research processes in the context of digital transformation and increasing interdisciplinarity. The project focused on developing quantitative methodologies to analyze how research outcomes transfer into scientific communities, businesses, and society at large, with particular attention to convergence processes between different research areas.

## Research Focus
- Analysis of knowledge dynamics in scientific innovation
- Development of methodologies to track research impact across domains
- Examination of convergence processes between disciplines
- Comparative study of life sciences and economics

## Methodology
The project employed a multidisciplinary approach combining:
- Text and data mining techniques
- Network analysis
- Semantic technologies
- Graph theory
- Social science research methods

## Data Sources
The research was based on extensive datasets including:
- Over 50 million metadata records
- 10 million full-text articles and patent specifications
- Publication corpora from life sciences and economics

## ZB MED's Role
ZB MED contributed to the project by:
- Analyzing knowledge dynamics in life sciences
- Developing methodologies for cross-disciplinary comparison
- Applying text and data mining techniques
- Supporting data integration and analysis
- Contributing to the development of forecasting methods

## Key Outcomes
- Enhanced understanding of knowledge transfer mechanisms
- Methodologies for analyzing interdisciplinary research impact
- Insights into convergence processes between scientific fields
- Framework for comparing research dynamics across disciplines
- Valuable data resources for future scientometric research

## Impact
The findings from Q-Aktiv provide valuable insights for:
- Research policy development
- Strategic research planning
- Technology transfer offices
- Funding agencies
- Academic institutions

## Project Legacy
The methodologies and datasets developed during Q-Aktiv continue to serve as a foundation for ongoing research in scientometrics and research evaluation, particularly in understanding the complex dynamics of interdisciplinary research and knowledge transfer.
