description: "The project Journalistic Information Extraction (JoIE) aims to address the problem of information extraction from unstructured sources, that are relevant for (data) journalism. Based on the two state-of-the-art tools Workbench and Fonduer, a solution is going to be developed that can handle the above-mentioned data sources and makes them usable for journalism by putting them into a structured and thus analyzable form."

Preprints are a relatively new pathway of making scientific results available to the wider research community even before peer review. Meanwhile, thereis are a large number of different preprint servers used by the research community, which differ both technically and in terms of content. In the project proposed here, the partners TH Köln – University of Applied Sciences and ZB MED - Information Center for Life Sciences would like to systematically unlock the previously neglected information source preprint servers, make them more accessible through value-added services and ensure the reusability of the metadata and full texts obtained. For this, the project will conduct research and develop an e-research technology covering an information extraction pipeline in which the data will be homogenized and merged into the ZB MED Knowledge Environment (ZB MED KE). Value-added services, such as Linked Open Data interfaces and innovative reputation and trend indicators, will then be developed on this data basis and made available to the library and scientific community for subsequent use.
