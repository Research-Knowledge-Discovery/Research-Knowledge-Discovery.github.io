## Project Overview
RDMTraining4NFDI is dedicated to establishing a comprehensive training framework for Research Data Management (RDM) within the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI). The project focuses on developing the necessary competencies for effective data, metadata, software, and machine learning model management in line with FAIR principles and Open Science practices.

## Key Objectives
- Develop modular teaching materials and didactic concepts for discipline-specific RDM training
- Implement diverse training formats including online workshops and summer schools
- Create an NFDI certification framework for RDM skills
- Establish a communication network for RDM training experts
- Publish training materials as Open Educational Resources (OER)

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Initialization Phase** (February 2025 - January 2026)
   - Develop core training materials and resources
   - Establish the certification framework
   - Conduct pilot training sessions
   - Build the trainer and data steward network

2. **Subsequent Phases**
   - Expand training formats and materials
   - Implement content creation workflows
   - Establish accreditation processes
   - Conduct quality assurance and evaluation

## ZB MED's Role
As a key partner and consortium spokesperson, ZB MED contributes to the project through:
- Development of training materials and open educational resources
- Delivery of diverse training formats for data stewards and trainers
- Creation of a certification framework and qualification standards
- Building and maintaining a community network for RDM professionals
- Conducting quality assurance and evaluation of training measures
- Performing comparative analyses to optimize training content and delivery

## Expected Impact
The project aims to enhance the efficiency and quality of RDM training across NFDI consortia, fostering widespread adoption of FAIR principles and Open Science practices throughout the German research landscape.
