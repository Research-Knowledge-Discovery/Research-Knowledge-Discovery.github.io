## Project Overview
KGI4NFDI addresses the critical need for a centralized knowledge graph infrastructure within the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI). By providing robust solutions for knowledge graph creation, management, and utilization, the project significantly enhances data interoperability and supports the FAIR principles across diverse research domains.

## Core Objectives
- Establish a comprehensive KG registry for NFDI consortia
- Develop an access service for cross-project knowledge graph sharing
- Support research communities in creating decentralized knowledge graphs
- Standardize ontological practices across NFDI
- Foster international collaboration through partnerships (e.g., EOSC)

## Key Components
1. **KG Registry**
   - Centralized repository of knowledge graphs from NFDI consortia
   - Metadata and documentation for each registered knowledge graph
   - Search and discovery capabilities

2. **Access Service**
   - Secure and efficient data sharing mechanisms
   - Standardized APIs for knowledge graph access
   - Support for various query languages and protocols

3. **Community Support**
   - Technical guidance and best practices
   - Tools and frameworks for KG development
   - Training and capacity building

## ZB MED's Role
As the coordinating institution, ZB MED leads the project through:
- Development of the central platform
- Project coordination and management
- Serving as the main point of contact (spokesperson)
- Ensuring alignment with NFDI's broader objectives

## Expected Impact
- Enhanced data integration across NFDI consortia
- Improved standardization of ontological practices
- Strengthened implementation of FAIR principles
- Facilitated international research collaboration
- Sustainable infrastructure for long-term knowledge graph management
