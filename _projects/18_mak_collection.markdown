The MAK Collection for Occupational Health and Safety is a comprehensive resource that publishes the "List of MAK and BAT Values" as an open-access publication. Compiled by the German Research Foundation (DFG), the list defines recommended limits for chemical compounds in workplace air. MAK (Maximale Arbeitsplatz-Konzentration) refers to maximum workplace concentration, while BAT (Biologische Arbeitsstoff-Toleranzwerte) stands for biological tolerance values.

## Project Scope
The MAK Collection currently contains:
- Evaluations and monitoring methods for over 1,000 hazardous compounds
- Approximately 80 new evaluations added annually
- Around 25 new monitoring methods introduced each year
- Annual publication in German, English, and Spanish

## Content Details
The list includes:
- Toxicological evaluations of chemical compounds
- Recommended monitoring methods
- Documentation of toxicological evaluations
- Mechanisms of action for each compound
- Practical recommendations for employee protection

## ZB MED's Role
ZB MED is responsible for publishing the MAK Collection through an online portal, which includes:
- Detailed explanations of recommended limits
- Measurement and monitoring method details
- Publication on the PUBLISSO platform for gold open access
- Ensuring accessibility to both scientific community and general public
