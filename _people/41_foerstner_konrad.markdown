Prof. Dr. Konrad Förstner holds a joint professorship for Data and
Information Literacy at [ZB MED - Information Center for Life
Sciences](https://www.zbmed.de/en/research/research-at-zb-med/research-data-science-and-services/)
and [TH Köln](https://www.th-koeln.de/). The research of his group
covers a broad spectrum of applications of data science,
bioinformatics and systems biology methods in the life sciences. This
includes the integration and interpretation of large data sets -
mainly generated using high-throughput sequencing technologies but
also biomedical text corpora - with the aim to translate them into
novel biological and medical insights. Additionally, the groups runs
projects that use and extend the knowledge commons by making research
outcomes more open and FAIR. Among other activities Prof. Förstner is
the speaker of the NFDI consortium
[NFDI4Microbiota](https://nfdi4microbiota.de/).
